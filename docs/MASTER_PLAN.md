    def analyze_upgrade_impact(self, package: str, from_version: str, to_version: str):
        """
        Analyze impact of upgrading a dependency.

        Returns:
        - Breaking changes detected: True/False
        - Affected repos: List[str]
        - Recommended action: "upgrade_now" | "test_first" | "wait"

        - Downstream dependencies
        """
```

**GitHub Workflow**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/dependency-intelligence.yml
name: Dependency Intelligence Report

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Weekly Monday midnight

jobs:

## Quick Wins (Implement First)

These provide immediate value with minimal effort:

### 1. GitHub Actions Centralization (2 hours)

**What**: Store all common workflows in security-central, reference from other repos.

**How**:
```yaml
# In PoshGuard/.github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Scan

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  scan:
    uses: cboyd0319/security-central/.github/workflows/reusable-security-scan.yml@main
    with:
      tech_stack: powershell
```

**Value**: Update workflow once, applies to all repos.

---

### 2. Dependency Update Batching (4 hours)

**What**: Group Dependabot PRs into weekly batches.

**How**:
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml (in each repo)
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "monday"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    groups:
      security-updates:
        patterns:
          - "*"
        update-types:
          - "patch"
          - "minor"
```

**Value**: Review 1 PR/week instead of 20.

---

### 3. Auto-Close Stale Issues (1 hour)

**What**: Close issues with no activity in 90 days.

**How**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/stale.yml
name: Close Stale Issues

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  stale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/stale@v9
        with:
          stale-issue-message: 'This issue has been inactive for 90 days. Closing.'
          days-before-stale: 90
          days-before-close: 7
```

**Value**: Less noise, cleaner issue trackers.

---

### 4. Cross-Repo Search (2 hours)

**What**: Search code across all 4 repos from security-central.

**How**:
```bash
# scripts/tools/cross_repo_search.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./cross_repo_search.sh "TODO.*SECURITY"

PATTERN=$1
for repo in PoshGuard BazBOM JobSentinel PyGuard; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  rg "$PATTERN" repos/$repo/ || echo "No matches"
done
```

**Value**: Find all TODOs, FIXMEs, security issues in one command.

---

### 5. Unified Issue Tracker (3 hours)

**What**: Create issues in security-central that spawn issues in individual repos.

**How**:
```python
# scripts/tools/create_cross_repo_issue.py
def create_issue_in_all_repos(title: str, body: str, labels: List[str]):
    """
    Create same issue in all 4 repos.
    Use case: "Update Python to 3.13 across all projects"
    """
    for repo in ['PoshGuard', 'BazBOM', 'JobSentinel', 'PyGuard']:
        subprocess.run([
            'gh', 'issue', 'create',
            '--repo', f'cboyd0319/{repo}',
            '--title', title,
            '--body', body,
            '--label', ','.join(labels)
        ])
```

**Value**: Coordinate work across repos.

---

## Advanced Features (Future)

### Multi-Cloud Deployment

**What**: Deploy security-central to AWS/GCP/Azure for faster scans.

**Why**: GitHub Actions have 6-hour timeout. Large scans may need more time.

**How**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/cloud-scan.yml
- name: Trigger AWS Lambda scan
  run: |
    aws lambda invoke \
      --function-name security-central-scanner \
      --payload '{"repos": ["PoshGuard", "BazBOM", "JobSentinel", "PyGuard"]}'
```

---

### Security Metrics API

**What**: Expose security metrics via REST API.

**Why**: Integrate with other tools (Jira, ServiceNow, etc.)

**How**:
```python
# api/security_metrics.py
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/v1/metrics')
def get_metrics():
    return jsonify({
        'overall_score': 87,
        'vulnerabilities': {
            'critical': 0,
            'high': 2,
            'medium': 12
        },
        'last_scan': '2025-10-18T09:00:00Z'
    })
```

---

### Custom Compliance Frameworks

**What**: Define your own compliance rules (company-specific).

**How**:
```yaml
# config/custom_compliance.yml
company_security_policy:
  rules:
    - id: COMPANY-001
      name: "All APIs must use API keys"
      severity: HIGH
      check: |
        rg "@app.route\(" --files-without-match "require_api_key"

    - id: COMPANY-002
      name: "All database queries must be parameterized"
      severity: CRITICAL
      check: |
        rg "execute\(.*%.*\)" --type py
```
