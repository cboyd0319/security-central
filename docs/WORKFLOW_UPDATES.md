- Automated test execution with pytest
- Coverage report generation
- Integration with Codecov.io

### 3. README Badge Updates

Added two new badges:
1. **Test & Coverage** workflow badge
2. **CodeCov** coverage badge

All existing badges verified and confirmed working.

## Workflows Modified

1. ✅ **codeql-analysis.yml** - Security code analysis
2. ✅ **daily-security-scan.yml** - Daily vulnerability scanning
3. ✅ **emergency-response.yml** - Critical CVE response
4. ✅ **housekeeping.yml** - Repository maintenance
5. ✅ **orchestrator.yml** - Multi-repo security orchestration
6. ✅ **scorecard.yml** - OSSF security scorecard
7. ✅ **secret-scan.yml** - Secret detection
8. ✅ **weekly-audit.yml** - Weekly dependency audit
9. ✨ **test.yml** - NEW: Test execution and coverage

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All updates are backward compatible within their respective major versions.

## Security Improvements

1. **Pinned Versions**: TruffleHog now uses a pinned version (v3.90.11) instead of @main, ensuring reproducibility and preventing unexpected breaking changes.

2. **Latest Security Patches**: All security scanning actions updated to include the latest vulnerability detection patterns and security improvements.

3. **CodeQL v4**: Upgraded to the latest CodeQL engine with improved detection capabilities for security vulnerabilities.

## Performance Improvements

1. **setup-python v6**: Improved caching reduces workflow execution time
2. **checkout v5**: Faster git operations and better handling of large repositories
3. **upload-artifact v4.6.2**: Better compression and faster uploads

## Testing & Validation

All workflows have been validated for:
- ✅ YAML syntax correctness
- ✅ Action version availability
- ✅ Compatibility with existing configurations
- ✅ Proper integration with GitHub Actions ecosystem

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Workflows**: Watch for any issues in the next few runs
2. **CodeCov Setup**: Configure CODECOV_TOKEN secret for coverage reporting
3. **Test Execution**: Add actual tests to the tests/ directory as the codebase grows
